# IFT2015 - Data Structures - H17

This repository contains the assignments for the data structures class I took during Winter 2017 at the Université de Montréal. 

They are organized as such:

* Each assignment is regrouped in its own folder, named **TP#**, where *#* is the number of the given assignment.
* In each folder, you will find the instructions for the given assignment (in french), named **00\_TP#_\_Name\_of\_assignment_.pdf**.
* You will also find various *.txt* files that are used as inputs for the programs.
* The main code for a given assignment has been given the name **TP#.py** while some classes are found in another *.py* file with another name.
